I am currently working as a security researcher at [zkSecurity](https://zksecurity.xyz). 

Occasionally, I write technical articles on this blog.
However, most of my writing is published on zkSecurity's company blog these days.
[Here](https://github.com/marcobesier/research) is a selection of some of my more recent posts.

I also used to publish a lot of content about security research on X.
However, I decided to retire from social media.
