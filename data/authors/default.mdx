I am currently working as a security research intern at [zkSecurity](https://zksecurity.xyz).

I occasionally write on this blog and used to publish a lot of content about Web3 development and security research on X.
However, I decided to retire from social media. [Probably you should, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E7hkPZ-HTk)
