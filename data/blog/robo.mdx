## World: Logo

### Level 1

```
example (A B C : Prop) : ¬((¬B ∨ ¬ C) ∨ (A → B)) → (¬A ∨ B) ∧ ¬ (B ∧ C) := by
  tauto
```

### Level 2

```
example : 42 = 42 := by
  rfl
```

### Level 3

```
example (n : ℕ) (h₁ : 10 > n) (h₂ : 1 < n) (h₃ : n ≠ 5) : 1 < n := by
  assumption
```

### Level 4

```
example (A : Prop) (hA : A) : A := by
  assumption
```

### Level 5

```
example : True := by
  decide
```

### Level 6

```
example : ¬False := by
  decide
```

### Level 7

```
example (A : Prop) (h : False) : A := by
  contradiction
```

### Level 8

```
example (n : ℕ) (h : n ≠ n) : n = 37 := by
  contradiction
```

### Level 9

```
example (n : ℕ) (h : n = 10) (g : n ≠ 10) : n = 42 := by
  contradiction
```

### Level 10

```
example (A B : Prop) (hA : A) (hB : B) : A ∧ B := by
  constructor
  assumption
  assumption
```

### Level 11

```
example (A B C : Prop) (h : A ∧ (B ∧ C)) : B := by
  obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  obtain ⟨h₃, h₄⟩ := h₂
  assumption
```

### Level 12

```
example (A B : Prop) (hA : A) : A ∨ (¬ B) := by
  left
  assumption
```

### Level 13

```
example (A B : Prop) (h : (A ∧ B) ∨ A) : A := by
  obtain h | h := h
  obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  assumption
  assumption
```

### Level 14

```
example (A B C : Prop) (h : A ∨ (B ∧ C)) : (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C) := by
  constructor
  obtain h | h := h
  left
  assumption
  obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  right
  assumption
  obtain h | h := h
  left
  assumption
  obtain ⟨h₁, h₂⟩ := h
  right
  assumption
```
