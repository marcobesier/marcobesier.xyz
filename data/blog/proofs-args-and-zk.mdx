## Chapter 3: Definitions and Technical Preliminaries

### Exercise 3.1

Let $A, B, C$ be $n \times n$ matrices over a field $\mathbb{F}$.
In Section 2.2, we presented a randomized algorithm for checking that $C = A \cdot B$.
The algorithm picked a random field element $r$, let $x = \left( r, r^2,...,r^n \right)$, and output EQUAL if $Cx = A \cdot (Bx)$, and output NOT-EQUAL otherwise.
Suppose instead that each entry of the vector $x$ is chosen independently and uniformly at random from $\mathbb{F}$. 
Show that:

- If $C_{ij} = (AB)_{ij}$ for all $i = 1,...,n, j = 1,...,n$, then the algorithm outputs EQUAL for every possible choice of $x$.

- If there is even one $(i,j) \in [n] \times [n]$ such that $C_{ij} \neq (AB)_{ij}$, then the algorithm outputs NOT-EQUAL with probability at least $1 - 1/|\mathbb{F}|$.

#### Solution

First, let $x = (x_1,...,x_n)\in \mathbb{F}^n$, where each $x_i$ is chosen independently and uniformly at random from $\mathbb{F}$.
Furthermore, let $D = A \cdot B$, so that our goal is to determine whether the $\textit{claimed}$ product matrix $C$ actually equals the $\textit{true}$ product matrix $D$.

The first property (completeness) is easy to see:
if $C=D$, then clearly $Cx=Dx$ for any $x\in \mathbb{F}^n$, so the algorithm will output EQUAL for every choice of $x$.

To see that the second property (soundness) holds, let us define the matrix $E := C-D$.
Furthermore, suppose $C\neq D$, i.e., $E\neq 0$.
Since $E$ is non-zero, we have that $\text{rank}(E) \geq 1$.
By the [rank-nullity theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank%E2%80%93nullity_theorem), we then have that $\text{dim(ker}(E)) \leq n-1$.
Since our vector coordinates $x_i$ are sampled independently and uniformly at random from $\mathbb{F}$, the soundness error is given by 
$$
\text{Pr}_{x\in \mathbb{F}^n}[Ex=0] = \frac{|\text{ker}(E)|}{|\mathbb{F}^n|}\leq \frac{|\mathbb{F}^{n-1}|}{|\mathbb{F}^{n}|} = \frac{1}{|\mathbb{F}|}
$$

In other words, if there is even one $(i,j) \in [n] \times [n]$ such that $C_{ij} \neq (AB)_{ij}$, then the algorithm outputs NOT-EQUAL with probability at least $1 - 1/|\mathbb{F}|$.

### Exercise 3.2

In Section 2.1, we described a communication protocol of logarithmic cost for determining whether Alice's and Bob's input vectors are equal.
Specifically, Alice and Bob interpreted their inputs as degree-$n$ univariate polynomials $p_a$ and $p_b$, chose a random $r \in \mathbb{F}$ with $|\mathbb{F}|>>n$, and compared $p_a(r)$ to $p_b(r)$.
Give a different communication protocol in which Alice and Bob interpret their inputs as multilinear rather than univariate polynomials over $\mathbb{F}$.
How large should $\mathbb{F}$ be to ensure that the probability Bob outputs the wrong answer is at most $1/n$?
What is the communication cost in bits of this protocol?

### Exercise 3.3

Let $p = 11$. Consider the function $f:\{0,1\}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_p$ given by $f(0,0)=3, f(0,1)=4, f(1,0)=1$, and $f(1,1)=2$.
Write out an explicit expression for the multilinear extension $\tilde{f}$ of $f$. 
What is $\tilde{f}(2,4)$?

Now consider the function $f: \{0,1\}^3\rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p$ given by $f(0,0,0)=1, f(0,1,0)=2, f(1,0,0)=3, f(1,1,0)=4, f(0,0,1)=5, f(0,1,1)=6, f(1,0,1)=7, f(1,1,1)=8$.
What is $\tilde{f}(2,4,6)$?
How many field multiplications did you perform during the calculation?
Can you work through the calculation of $\tilde{f}(2,4,6)$ that uses "just" 20 multipliactions operations?
Hint: see Lemma 3.8.

### Exercise 3.4

Fix some prime $p$ of your choosing.
Write a Python program that takes as input an array of lenght $2^l$ specifying all evaluations of a function $f: \{0,1\}^l \rightarrow \mathbb{F}_p$ and a vector $\mathbf{r}\in \mathbb{F}_p^l$, and outputs $\tilde{f}(\mathbf{r})$.
